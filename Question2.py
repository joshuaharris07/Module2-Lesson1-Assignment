#Python Naming Convention Practice

#Task 1: Code Correction 
# You have been given a piece of code with several variable and constant names that don't follow the Python naming convention. 
# Your task is to correct them:

PI = 3.14                   #changed to PI and uppercase as the value of pi doesn't change and having value added is unnecesary.
user_age = 25               #Separate the two words with an underscore and lower case "age"
user_location = "New York"  #no need to change, it is correct.
MAX_LIMIT = 1000            #Needed an _ between the words.
